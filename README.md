# CKEditor 4 Workflows Common

Shared CKEditor 4 GitHub workflows.

## How it works?

The main function of this repository is to propagate common workflows and keep them up to date.

The `setup-workflows.yml` workflow checkouts this repository once a day in the target repository and updates (or creates) all common workflows. Common workflows are stored in `workflows/` directory here and are copied to `.github/workflows/` directory in a target repository. There is also `setup-workflows.yml` workflow there, which means, once it is set it will auto-update itself too.

## Setup

1. Copy `workflows/setup-workflows.yml` workflow to your repository as `.github/workflows/setup-workflows.yml`.
1. Setup `secrets.GH_BOT_USERNAME` and `secrets.GH_BOT_EMAIL` to GitHub user which has a push access to your repository.
1. Setup `secrets.GH_WORKFLOWS_TOKEN` to GitHub token which has `write` and `workflows` permissions.

## Optional configuration

Some workflows may be altered by configuration options (refer to [Available workflows](#available-workflows) section below). The configuration file is optional and not present by default. If needed, it should be added to any repository using common workflows as `.github/workflows-config.json` file.

### Loading configuration file

For any workflow which needs to load and use configuration values, it is recommended to load config as first step of entire workflow using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) like:

```yml
- name: Read config
  run: |
    echo "SETTINGS={}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    if [[ -f "./.github/workflows-config.json" ]]; then
      echo "SETTINGS=$( jq .workflowName './.github/workflows-config.json' )" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    fi
```

Then, further in the workflow any step can use $SETTINGS variable and read any configuration properties like:

```bash
$(echo ${{ env.SETTINGS }} | jq ".propertyName")
```

## Available workflows

### setup-workflows

This is the main workflow responsible for propagating all common workflows. When it is added to any other repository it checkouts this repository and copies all common workflows from `workflows/` directory to `.github/workflows/` one. It is run once a day (at 02:00 UTC) so any changes are propagated on a daily basis. See `workflows/setup-workflows.yml` file.

It is a cron job task so will be triggered only on main repository branch.

#### Required secrets

* `GH_WORKFLOWS_TOKEN` - GitHub token which is used for all commit/push/pr actions. It should have write and workflows access.
* `GH_BOT_EMAIL` - GitHub user email which acts as an author of all commits done by this job.
* `GH_BOT_USERNAME` - GitHub user username which acts as an author of all commits done by this job.

#### Optional configuration

* `setupWorkflows.pushAsPullRequest` : `Boolean` If set to true, workflows update will be created as PR instead of being pushed directly to the main branch.

### stalebot

Workflow responsible for handling stale issues and PRs. It is a cron job task so will be triggered only on a main repository branch. See `workflows/stalebot.yml` file.

#### Required secrets

_None_

#### Other requirements

Since this workflow uses labels to mark stale issues/PRs, labels should be already defined in the target repository:

* `stale` - label used to mark stale issues/PRs.
* `status:confirmed` - label used to filter out confirmed issues. Such issues are not processed by `stalebot`.
* `resolution:expired` - label added to stale issues which got closed due to inactivity.
* `pr:frozen ‚ùÑ` - label added to stale PRs which got closed due to inactivity.

### update-deps

Workflow responsible for updating NPM dependencies. It is run once a week (at 05:00 UTC on Monday) and creates two PRs (if there are any outdated dependencies) - one for dev dependencies and one for production ones. It checks `package.json` file in the repository root and uses `npm-check` to update all dev/prod dependencies (which means `package.json` versioning is not respected). It is a cron job task so will be triggered only on main repository branch. See `workflows/update-deps.yml` file.

#### Required secrets

* `GH_BOT_EMAIL` - GitHub user email which acts as an author of all commits done by this job.
* `GH_BOT_USERNAME` - GitHub user username which acts as an author of all commits done by this job.

#### Optional secrets

* `BRANCH_MAIN` - Target branch name. By default, workflow runs on main repository branch.
